# Liberia Railroaded
A story mod for the Paradox Interactive game 'Victoria 3' which focuses on Liberia

# GOALS
Create a story based experience for Liberia from its transition as a colonial company into democracy and it's expansion across West Africa to eventually form a "United States of West Africa"

Stock market market mechanic to show its transition from a single company into a nation with different industries competing against Europe, Asia and the Americas

New Political mechanics to represent the political diversity of the region and the competing interests of those involved.  It is hoped that a parliament like system can be developed and new laws added for more flavour
